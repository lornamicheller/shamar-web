          unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these
          Terms of Use and will not affect the
          validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Shamar's failure to insist upon or enforce strict
          performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or
          right. No waiver of any of these
          Terms of Use will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or
          condition. Shamar reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will
          not apply to disputes arising
          before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of
          any or all of your transactions with Shamar.</p>
