        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>11</b>. Metadata:

        <br>
        <b>11.1</b>. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>11.2</b>. Users may be able to add or have Metadata added to their Content including hash tags (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your Content more
        searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your video/photo
        is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.
